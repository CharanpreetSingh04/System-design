# System-design
System design is nothing but the design of system so that we can handle availablility, scalability, concurrency of the system with minimum tradeoffs.

Fundamental topics in System Design:
1. Database - most important and brittle part of the system.
2. Scaling - handle number of servers based on load of requests.
3. Concurrency - handle concurrent requests.
4. Caching - reduce the computation and store the result somewhere.
5. Delegation - delegation of work so that server becomes available to handle more requests.
6. Communication - communication of end users with the servers.
